# Student-Dropout-Prediction
Leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project aims to predict and prevent student dropouts by analyzing historical academic data. Through feature engineering and model training, we develop a predictive model to identify at-risk students, enabling timely intervention strategies. This project not only achieves an outstanding 92% accuracy but also provides a transparent and insightful process.

# How It Works

# 1. Data Gathering
Dataset: The project relies on a comprehensive dataset comprising carefully curated academic records. These records serve as the foundation for model training and evaluation. We took dataset from kaggle.

# 2. Data Preprocessing
Feature Engineering: Key features are selected and engineered to enhance the predictive capabilities of the models.

Data Cleaning: The dataset undergoes rigorous cleaning processes to ensure high-quality input for the models.

# 3. Model Building
   
Implemented Algorithms: We have explored a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Perceptron, and KNN.

Training and Optimization: Models are trained on the preprocessed data and fine-tuned for optimal performance.

Ensemble Techniques: Employ ensemble techniques to enhance predictive accuracy.

# 4. Predictive Analysis
To predict that particular student will dropout or not run the student-dropout-prediction.ipynb file.


# Setup and Usage

Requirements : Ensure pandas, scikit, matplotlib, seaborn, streamlit, sklearn, xgboost, numpy and jupyter notebook with anaconda3 navigator installed with all required dependencies.

Execution : Run the provided .ipynb file and ensure that you have downloaded .csv file and have all the required dependencies.

User Interaction : User can input their own data via webpage and to obtain dropout prediction.

Model Comparison : User can explore and compare the accuracy of the various models and decide which is effective model.
